Initially, each of us created our own mockups for a different class, focusing on a movie website. Eventually, we chose Yui's design as the foundation for our site, while also incorporating elements from Crystal's and my own designs. Our primary goal was to create a simple and user-friendly website that provides easy navigation. Additionally, we ensured that the site is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience across all devices."

Throughout the project, I delved into various aspects of React development, including making API calls, utilizing React Router, managing state with React Redux, leveraging React hooks (especially useEffect), and storing data locally. One of the highlights was discovering how to dynamically fetch data from APIs, transforming the app with real-time and dynamic content. Working collaboratively with my teammate was a great pleasure. Our strengths complemented each other, enabling us to support one another and keep the development process smooth and enjoyable. The supportive team environment made a significant difference in the overall experience. This movie database project taught me the value of collaboration and teamwork. We capitalized on each other's strengths, allowing us to tackle challenges effectively and efficiently. It was inspiring to witness how our combined efforts led to faster progress and the successful implementation of additional features. Celebrating the completion of the project as a team was truly rewarding. While there is room for improvement in organizing our code, the teamwork has resulted in a well-rounded project that reflects our collective dedication."

From there, I started with a site map and content plan to help organize things which led to a wireframe/mockup. I at first thought that the mockup I had previously created would serve me fine for this site however, I kept having second thoughts and new ideas as I was building. The following picture is what I had for the mockup and as you can see, the final site is quite a bit different."

This ensures the websites useability across all screen sizes and allows users the ability to access and navigate the site regardless of what they are using. Also, wherever possible, I wrote code in a way that can be reused in other places on the site to follow the 'DRY' principle. To facilitate content management and streamline the addition of new projects, I opted to utilize a JSON file to store all project information. This strategic decision separates content from code, making it effortless to update the site without requiring any code changes. I also used React Router to create a single page application. This allows the user to navigate the site without having to reload the page."

          "content": "This is my first big project and working on it alone. There were many difficulties that I came across as I was working away at this project. First and foremost, I started to dislike my original design and wanted to change it. I ended up changing the design quite a bit and while I am much happier with the final result, it took a lot of time as I couldn't just follow along a pre-made mockup. I also had a hard time with the JSON file. I had to do a lot of research to figure out how structure the actual file itself so I was able to pull the information and display it how I want on the site. Another thing is usage of Tailwind. Using tailwind felt very different and I had to fight the urge to just give up and move back to something more comfortable like SASS to style everything. I used Tailwind to style everything that I can but there were a few places where I couldn't get it to work properly. Despite all this, I felt I was able to learn a lot from this project and I am also happy that I was able to create a site that I can use to showcase my work."
